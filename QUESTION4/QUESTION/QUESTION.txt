QUESTION:What is the purpose of declaring variables in JavaScript, and how do you declare them using the
'let' keyword?
Answer:
1) The purpose of declaring the variables in JavaScript is to reserve the memory location for storing the data values that can be used throughout the programs. Variables act as a placeholder for data making it easier to work with and manipulate information in your code.Declaring variables allows you to :
1) Variables can store various types of data such as numbers, text and objects.
2) You can perform operation on data stored in variable such as calculation, concatinations and comparisons
3) Variables allows you to reuse the values at different points in your code reducing the redundancy.
4) Variable can be used to control the flow of your program through conditions and loops 

Declaring the Variables using the 'let' keyword
e.g) let name;
1) let -> this keyword indicates that you have declred the variable
2) name -> this is the variable name. You should use the JavaScript naming convention for naming the variable.

Declaring and initializing the variable
e.g) let name;//declaration 
name="Pratiksha";//initialization
In the first line you have declare the variable and in the second line you have initialize the variable

You can declare and initialize the variable in single line:
let name="pratiksha";
